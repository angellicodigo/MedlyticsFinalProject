# Medlytics Final Project
For the final project of MIT Beaver Works Summer Institute course "Medlytics", we created a program that detected dyslexia through images of handwriting. This is useful for kindergarten teachers to scan images of students' worksheets and detect early signs of dyslexia. This project includes data argumentation and multiple ML models.
